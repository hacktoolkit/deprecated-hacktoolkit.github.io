### What is it?

Hacktoolkit is a collection of bootstrap code that you can use to start your next project, whether it's a website or mobile app.

### Why Hacktoolkit?

The best way to get better at programming is to write code yourself, and learn from well-written code by others.

Hackathons are typically 24-48 programming competitions where a lot of programming nerds and geeks get together and build a functioning product from scratch--well, the rules typically are that all of your code and designs have to be done during the hackathon, not before--but using open-source code is an exception.

We aim to provide a level playing field for all hackathon attendees so that everyone has access to commonly written code, so that they can focus on **creating** (designing, developing), **rather than reinventing** at 24-48 hour hackathons.

Here are some things you'll find among the corpus of code at Hacktoolkit:

* Bootstrap code for websites and mobile apps
* Complete working demos and prototypes
* Implemented design patterns
* Algorithms and data structures in various languages, from simple to complex
* Working code that integrates with all of the popular APIs--Android, iOS, Google Play Services, Parse, and more!

Even if you're not using Hacktoolkit to build your hackathon-winning entry, but just working on a project as a hobby for yourself, Hacktoolkit can help you get started.

### Okay, I'm convinced. How do I get started?

* Clone the repository (`git clone git@github.com:hacktoolkit/hacktoolkit.git`) and start using it!
* Fork the repository if you want to contribute.
* Issue pull requests for new things to incorporate back into the `hacktoolkit` library. Formatting requirements TBD (provide a README.md and description of what your code does).

I'll add your name to the contributors list! If you would like to be a maintainer for Hacktoolkit, please contact <hello@hacktoolkit.com>.

### The nitty-gritty

In case you're the type interested in reading the fine print, here are the details.

#### Rules and Ethics

* Any code that has been in the repository is fair game for inclusion in hackathon competitions, but you should consult with your particular hackathon event's judges.
* Typically, you would add your code to Hacktoolkit as early as possible, and email or post a message to the discussion board for the hackathon event.
