{"name":"Hacktoolkit","tagline":"Win hackathons by using bootstrap code to build complete websites and apps in 24 hours.","body":"Hacktoolkit\r\n===========\r\n\r\n### What is it?\r\n\r\nHacktoolkit is a collection of bootstrap code that you can use to start your next project, whether it's a website or mobile app.\r\n\r\n### Why Hacktoolkit?\r\n\r\nThe best way to get better at programming is to write code yourself, and learn from well-written code by others.\r\n\r\nHackathons are typically 24-48 programming competitions where a lot of programming nerds and geeks get together and build a functioning product from scratch--well, the rules typically are that all of your code and designs have to be done during the hackathon, not before--but using open-source code is an exception.\r\n\r\nWe aim to provide a level playing field for all hackathon attendees so that everyone has access to commonly written code, so that they can focus on **creating** (designing, developing), **rather than reinventing** at 24-48 hour hackathons.\r\n\r\nHere are some things you'll find among the corpus of code at Hacktoolkit:\r\n\r\n* Bootstrap code for websites and mobile apps\r\n* Complete working demos and prototypes\r\n* Implemented design patterns\r\n* Algorithms and data structures in various languages, from simple to complex\r\n* Working code that integrates with all of the popular APIs--Android, iOS, Google Play Services, Parse, and more!\r\n\r\nEven if you're not using Hacktoolkit to build your hackathon-winning entry, but just working on a project as a hobby for yourself, Hacktoolkit can help you get started.\r\n\r\n### Okay, I'm convinced. How do I get started?\r\n\r\n* Clone the repository (`git clone git@github.com:hacktoolkit/hacktoolkit.git`) and start using it!\r\n* Fork the repository if you want to contribute.\r\n* Issue pull requests for new things to incorporate back into the `hacktoolkit` library. Formatting requirements TBD (provide a README.md and description of what your code does).\r\n\r\nI'll add your name to the contributors list! If you would like to be a maintainer for Hacktoolkit, please contact me (@jontsai).\r\n\r\n### The nitty-gritty\r\n\r\nIn case you're the type interested in reading the fine print, here are the details.\r\n\r\n#### Rules and Ethics\r\n\r\n* Any code that has been in the repository for a while is fair game for inclusion in hackathon competitions.\r\n* For using newly added code, you should consult with your particular hackathon event's judges.\r\n* Typically, you would add your code to Hacktoolkit as early as possible, and email or post a message to the discussion board for the hackathon event.\r\n\r\n#### License\r\n\r\n* All code uploaded to Hacktoolkit will be available under the MIT license. I spent hours reading about different open source licenses, and it seems that MIT can actually be incorporated into commercial products.\r\n* Google's Android project uses the Apache license, but I think I slightly like the MIT license better. Subjectively, the majority of the cool open source projects that I've seen use MIT.\r\n* GNU license, or any variant thereof, is definitely not an option.\r\n* IANAL (I am not a lawyer), so would anyone who is more knowledgeable than I on the subject please educate me?\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n\r\n* Jonathan Tsai (@jontsai), founded Hacktoolkit in September 2013\r\n","google":"UA-43807579-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
